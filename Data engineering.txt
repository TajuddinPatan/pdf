10 Weeks
Strong basics are non-negotiable. That's why we start with programming fundamentals - SQL, Python.

Python will help you write clean code, solve problems, and handle complex datasets with ease.

SQL, on the other hand, is the key to extracting and managing data from real-world databases.

Together, they’ll give you the confidence to engineer scalable data pipelines and tackle the challenges of modern data systems head-on.

Topics covered:

SQL

Intro to SQL and Advance Select
Joins
Sorting and Grouping
Aggregation
CTEs
Subqueries
Advance string functions, regex/clause
Windowing Functions
Recursive CTE
Python

Python Refresher
Functional Programming
Modules,Errors and Exceptions
OOPS
NumPy
Pandas + Data Visualisation
Project: Navigating the Stock market with Python

Module 2 - Data Engineering Fundamentals
clock_icon
5 Weeks
Now that your basics are clear, it’s time to move into Data Engineering Fundamentals. This module is all about three core areas: data management systems, data warehousing, and data modeling.

In data management systems, you’ll understand how relational and NoSQL databases actually work covering indexing, clustering, sharding, and the difference between OLTP and OLAP.

In data warehousing, you’ll see how large-scale data is stored, organized, and optimized for analysis, while also getting hands-on with tools like DBT and Airflow.

In data modeling, you’ll practice designing schemas and solving real-world problems across domains like banking, e-commerce, and healthcare.

By the end, you’ll know how to design, manage, and scale data systems—the core of being a data engineer.

Topics covered:

Database Management Systems

Introduction to Database
Types of Database - RDBMS, NoSQL, Columnar, Graph (With real-world use cases)

Module 3 - Data Engineering Tools
clock_icon
6 weeks
You’ve already built your basics in programming and data engineering fundamentals. Now it’s time to use and learn the actual tools that data engineers work with daily

First, you’ll learn ETL and integration tools like DBT, Airflow, and Fivetran these help you move data and shape it the way you need.

Next, you’ll get into big data platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Hadoop; the same systems companies rely on to manage data at massive scale.

You’ll dive into Apache Spark and Kafka to learn how massive data streams are processed and delivered in real time. From there, you’ll explore how large-scale data systems are designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and reliability.

By the end, you’ll know how to build, orchestrate, and manage pipelines that are ready for real-world performance.

Topics covered:

ETL - Data Integration Tools

DBT
Apache Airflow
fivetran
Big Data Fundamentals

Snowflake
Google Bigquery
Databricks
Hadoop distributed file system

5 weeks
Almost every big product company runs their data on the cloud and now you’ll learn how to do it too.

You’ll work with the three important platforms: AWS, GCP, and Azure. Step by step, you’ll see how data is stored, processed, and secured using services like Amazon S3, RDS, Glue, Google BigQuery, Dataflow, and Azure Synapse.

And to complete your cloud learning, you’ll dive into DevOps for Data Engineering mastering CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, and containerization using Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.

By the end, you’ll be prepared to design and manage scalable, secure, and efficient cloud-based data solutions across multiple environments.
